                <h3>The 12 Best Songs of 2020 (So Far): Staff Picks</h3>
                <p>The first half of 2020 has posed many questions most of us never thought we'd<br>
                    have to answer in our lifetime, including: "What does pop mean in a world of<br>
                    have to answer in our lifetime, including: "What does pop mean in a world of
                    <br>
                    intended -- in communal spaces like concert halls, dance clubs, bars and even<br>
                    private parties -- can it even really still be called pop music?<br> </p>
                <p>The answer, of course, is yes. We've found that in times of quarantine and other<br>
                    crises, music is as meaningful as ever, even just as the soundtrack to such<br>
                    menial activities as doing the dishes, taking a walk around the block or just  <br>
                    sitting at home and wondering when or if things will feel normal again. As <br>
                    difficult as this period has been, we doubt we could've gotten by without these<br>
                    songs -- and we look forward to making up for lost time with them at whatever<br>
                    point we're finally able to celebrate them publicly.</p>
                
                
                <p>Here are Billboard's 50 favorite songs of the year so far, with a Spotify playlist<br>
                    featuring all 50 of them at the bottom.</p>

                <h3>1. The Weeknd, "Blinding Lights"</h3>
                <p>Sometimes the best songs are ones you think you’ve heard before -- but from a<br>
                    different artist and a different time. “Blinding Lights” is like that. The opening<br>
                    drumbeat is a DeLorean back to Michael Jackson’s “Beat It.” The amphetamine<br>
                    synth conjures fond memories of leopard-print-era Rod Stewart’s “Young Turks”<br>
                    -- or maybe that other guy with the avian hairdo, Mike Score from A Flock of<br>
                    Seagulls?  And isn’t that spooky B-movie organ from Rockwell’s “Somebody’s<br>
                    Watching Me”?  Whoah, stop thinking so much, dude, and let Abel Tesfaye’s<br>
                    Drambuie-drenched vocals bathe you in euphoria as you bop around your<br>
                    home in an M-95 mask, punching your fist to the “Hey!-Hey!-Hey!”’s, and giving <br>
                    thanks to Max Martin and The Weeknd for making a magical and much-needed<br>
                    tonic for troubled times. -- FRANK DIGIACOMO</p>

                <h3>2. Megan Thee Stallion feat. Beyoncé, "Savage (Remix)"</h3>
                <p>Houston, we got a problem! When the city's noblest daughters in Megan Thee<br>
                    Stallion and Beyoncé joined forces on the "Savage" remix, some considered it an<br>
                    anointment, crowning Meg as the premier female rapper in hip-hop. With<br>
                    Beyoncé riding shotgun, Megan's dynamic single received an extra jolt of<br>
                    rawness when Queen Bey gave her stamp of approval for OnlyFans enthusiasts,<br>
                    Demon Time warriors, and more. While Bey surfed through the J. White Did It<br>
                    beat with calm precision, Megan's husky hook ("I'm a Savage/ Classy, bougie,<br>
                    ratchet") remained the backbone for the swaggering track. Ultimately, the<br>
                    Houston connection proved to be timely, as Megan landed her first Hot 100 No. 1<br>
                    last month with the record. -- C.L.</p>

                <h3>3. Harry Styles, "Adore You"</h3>
                <p>
                    Though released in December 2019, Harry Styles’ Fine Line grew roots in 2020 <br>
                    thanks to undeniably catchy singles “Adore You” and “Watermelon Sugar.” And
                    while lead single “Lights Up” officially ushered in Styles’ second album, it’s the Top<br>
                    40-friendlier “Adore You” that best marks his place in pop today -- and scored<br>
                    him his first No. 1 on Billboard’s Pop Songs radio airplay chart. After all, in<br>
                    addition to a gorgeously crafted hit, there are few things better than having<br>
                    someone plea through pitch-perfect vocals to “just let me adore you.” Only a<br>
                    fool would turn down an offer like that. -- L.H.</p>

                <h3>4. Doja Cat, "Say So"</h3>
                <p>Even in a year where top 40 has been absolutely swarming with disco retro,<br>
                    there's an ease to the throwback elements of Doja Cat's "Say So" that makes it <br>
                    feel the least consciously backwards-looking of the year's best floor-fillers. The
                    singer-rapper born Amalaratna Zandile Dlamini glides on the beat like she's<br>
                    doing a lap around the roller rink, her airy coo and over-caffeinated spitting<br>
                    both matching the sublime guitar-chop funk as naturally as Diana Ross<br>
                    jamming with Nile Rodgers 40 years earlier. </p>

                <h3>5. Roddy Ricch, "The Box"</h3>
                <p>Roddy Ricch got an early bid on claiming one of 2020’s most popular songs <br>
                    when “The Box” snared the Hot 100’s top rung in January, and stayed there 11<br>
                    weeks. Between the track’s hypnotic uptempo beat, brain-sticking hook (“I won't<br>
                    never sell my soul”), Ricch’s vocal fervor and squeaky “eee err” ad-lib -- which<br>
                    launched countless memes and TikTok videos -- “The Box” was the Compton,<br>
                    Calif. rapper’s mainstream breakthrough. As Ricch told Billboard, “It just bangs.<br>
                    The 808s hit so hard.” -- G.M.<br> </p>

            <div id="6._Lady_Gaga,_Stupid_Love" class="main selection">
                <h3>6. Lady Gaga, "Stupid Love"</h3>
                <p>Gaga's smart enough to know that after leaving the dancefloor for a spell, you <br>
                    don't just come barreling back in at 11, and her return to Mother Monster territory<br>
                    on "Stupid Love" is a wonder of build-and-release ecstasy. Opening with a
                    quivering electro-pop rhythm, Gaga matches the nervous energy of the<br>
                    Moroder-esque synth with a tentative, sweet croon, gradually working her way<br>
                    back up to the full-bore rapture of her early days. When she retakes the throne<br>
                    on the throbbing, shout-it-to-the-heavens chorus, it's clear she's truly at home:<br>
                    The Academy Awards might be a nice place to visit, and the widescreen<br>
                    ranches of Joanne have charm, but for species Gaga, Club Chromatica is the<br>
                    natural habitat. -- J. Lynch<br></p>

                <h3>7. Christine & The Queens, "People, I've Been Sad"</h3>
                <p>The French singer has long been a master of the depressionbanger -- those
                    <br>
                    transcendent pop anthems that are equal parts muscle and melancholy -- yet <br>
                    her simple declarations of solitude here nail the feeling of watching days slip by<br>
                    better than anything in her catalog. The chorus also offers a fitting snapshot of<br>
                    quarantine life: By pitching down her vocals and putting herself in conversation<br>
                    with her own voice, she's apart but not totally alone. And right now, you<br>
                    definitely know the feeling. -- NOLAN FEENEY</p>

                <p>The second single from Future Nostalgia opens with a 13-second instrumental,
                    <br>
                    and for that, we should all be grateful. It’s just enough time to summon everyone <br>
                    within earshot to the dance floor and to mentally prepare yourself to give<br>
                    everything you’ve got for the next three minutes. After that, all bets are off --<br>
                    thumping bass, well-timed claps and a bursting chorus combine to make a<br>
                    frenetic ‘80s-influenced jam that pays dutiful homage to the Olivia Newton-<br>
                    John jazzercise effort that helped inspire it. “Physical” is nothing short of an <br>
                    adrenaline-filled powerhouse that will rejuvenate any party for years to come.<br>

                    the entire planet is burning. "Delete Forever" resonates more and more the<br>
                    further we get into the most unprecedented year of many of our lifetimes, not<br>
                    just for its lyrics of extreme anxiety ("Lying so awake, things I can't escape") and<br>
                    disillusionment ("Innocence was fleeting like a season") but for its overall feeling<br>
                    of surrender to oblivion's inevitability. "I see everything," Grimes laments -- an<br>
                    imperfect oracle to be sure, but one whose visions we can't help but keep<br>

                <h3>10. Dixie Chicks, "Gaslighter</h3>
                <p>With "Gaslighter," the Dixie Chicks came roaring back from a 14-year hiatus. The<br>
                    song channels the anger of a woman scorned by her husband -- lead singer <br>
                    Natalie Maines seemingly draws from her real life relationship with ex Adrian<br>
                    Pasdar -- and perhaps fits best as the spiritual prequel to "Goodbye Earl." (They<br>
                    haven't poisoned his black-eyed-peas just yet.) Weaponizing their gorgeous<br>
                    vocal harmonies against the man who did wrong, "Gaslighter" provides a foot-<br>
                    stomping, burn-it-all-to-the-ground good time. The Chicks are still not ready to<br>
                    make nice, and that's perfectly fine with us. -- DENISE WARNER</p>

                <h3>11. BENEE feat. Gus Dapperton, "Supalonely"</h3>
                <p>BENEE had already found success in her home country of New Zealand with her<br>
                    first EP of 2019, Fire on Marzz -- but it was follow-up Stella & Steve, and its <br>
                    happy-sad song “Supalonely,” featuring Gus Dapperton, that would send her<br>
                    skyrocketing internationally. Thanks to a TikTok dance challenge in March, the (They<br>
                    song entered the Hot 100 in 2020 and brought the 20-year-old’s bouncy tune to<br>
                    millions. Though inspired by a breakup and an isolating month spent recording<br>
                    in L.A., lines like “I know I f--ked up, I’m just a loser” don’t sound so morose when<br>
                    matched with the sunny melody, a “la la la la” series, the punctuating “I’ve been
                    lonely, mm, ah, yeah!” -- and of course those high kicks in the video. -<br>

                    The title track and mission statement for Selena Gomez's most personal album <br>
                    to date, the failing-relationship lament "Rare" is full of the production and lyrical<br>
                    detail that has set the last four years of the pop star's work apart. "Saw us
                    getting older/ Burning toast in the toaster/ My ambitions were too high," Gomez<br>
                    moans over subtly swinging bass and layered percussion, finding the stability<br>
                    and self-confidence to say what she needs. "I don't have it all/ I"m not claiming<br>
                    to/ But I know that I'm special," she proclaims, a hard-earned self-affirmation<br>
                    that feels like the culmination of something important for both Gomez and her<br>
                    long-devoted fans. -- A.U.</p>
